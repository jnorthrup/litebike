# GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

This file contains information about the AGPL-3.0 license that applies to LiteBike Proxy.

For the complete AGPL-3.0 license text, see:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html

## AGPL-3.0 Requirements

The AGPL-3.0 license requires that:

1. **Source Code Availability**: If you run this software as a network service, you must provide source code to users
2. **License Compatibility**: Your entire application must be AGPL-3.0 compatible
3. **Modifications**: Any modifications must also be AGPL-3.0 licensed
4. **Network Services**: Even SaaS/hosting requires source code disclosure
5. **Distribution**: All distributions must include AGPL-3.0 license notices

## Key Difference from GPL-3.0

**AGPL-3.0 closes the "SaaS loophole"**:
- GPL-3.0: Only requires source code when you distribute software
- AGPL-3.0: **Also** requires source code when you provide network services

This means hosting LiteBike as a service requires making your entire application open source.

## Alternative: Commercial License

To avoid AGPL-3.0 requirements and use LiteBike Proxy in proprietary applications:
- Purchase a commercial license from the copyright holder
- Contact via GitHub issues with "Commercial License" tag
- Maintain full proprietary rights to your own code
- No requirement to open source your application
