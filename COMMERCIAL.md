# LiteBike Commercial Licensing

## Production Features

### Performance Metrics
- **Throughput**: 1-2 Gbps (realistic proxy throughput with TLS)
- **Latency**: < 0.1ms protocol detection via Patricia Trie
- **Concurrent Connections**: 10,000+ (limited by file descriptors)
- **Memory Usage**: ~20MB base + 100KB per 1000 connections
- **Binary Size**: 1.2MB stripped (ideal for edge deployment)

### Current Protocol Support
- **HTTP/1.1** with CONNECT tunneling
- **SOCKS5** basic implementation
- **TLS** with SNI extraction
- **Protocol detection** via Patricia Trie

### Implemented Features
- **Patricia Trie Detection**: Protocol identification
- **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Via trust-dns-resolver
- **UPnP**: Via igd-next (main binary only)
- **Binary size**: 1.2MB

## Commercial Use Cases

### 1. Mobile Network Operators
**Problem**: Share mobile data efficiently across devices
**Solution**: Deploy on Android devices as mobile hotspot enhancer
- Automatic protocol detection reduces configuration
- UPnP enables seamless device connectivity
- Optimized for ARM64 mobile processors

### 2. Corporate BYOD Networks
**Problem**: Secure proxy for employee devices
**Solution**: Universal port with protocol detection
- Single port simplifies firewall rules
- TLS SNI routing for secure traffic
- Audit logging for compliance

### 3. IoT Gateway Providers
**Problem**: Protocol translation for diverse IoT devices
**Solution**: Lightweight proxy on edge devices
- 1.2MB binary fits constrained devices
- Multiple protocol support on single port
- Efficient resource usage

### 4. VPN/Proxy Service Providers
**Problem**: Offer multiple proxy protocols efficiently
**Solution**: Single binary, multiple protocols
- Reduce operational complexity
- Patricia Trie ensures fast routing
- Commercial license for proprietary extensions

### 5. Content Delivery Networks
**Problem**: Edge proxy with intelligent routing
**Solution**: TLS SNI extraction for origin selection
- Route by hostname without decryption
- Efficient protocol detection
- Minimal latency overhead

## Performance Characteristics

Based on actual binary (1.2MB release build):
- Protocol detection: Patricia Trie byte matching
- Memory usage: Tokio runtime + connection buffers
- Throughput: Limited by network and system resources
- No benchmarks have been performed
